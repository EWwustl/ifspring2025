    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc).</p>
            <p>My name is Yuchen (Eric) Wei, a senior CS major student.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</p>
            <p>I'm pursuing the HCI minor, and this class satisfies the minor requirements.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</p>
            <p>I have taken web development classes at WashU. Still, I wouldn't consider myself very proficient with
                plain HTML/CSS. I actually find JavaScript more comfortable to work with.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</p>
            <p>I hope to learn more about how to write and manipulate HTML/CSS directly, without relying on JavaScript.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</p>
            <p>When using the screen, I expect making quick prototype designs would be slower and less intuitive than
                using paper, but making edits later would be faster and easier than using paper.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.apple.com/" target="_blank">https://www.apple.com/</a></p>
            <p>I think Apple's website exemplifies effective design. It has a minimalistic, clean aesthetic, and its
                visual hierarchy is clear and impactful.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/</a></p>
            <p>I think Reddit exemplifies effective communication. It communicates all the relevant information in a
                straightforward manner, which allows for intuitive user experience.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/</a></p>
            <p>I think YouTube works well for having both effective design and effective communication. It looks
                pleasing with the page's layout (groups of big pictures with texts below them), and it displays its
                contents clearly (showing all necessary data and easy navigation).</p>
