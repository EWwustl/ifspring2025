        <h2>Recipe websites:</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.hellofresh.com/recipes/crispy-cheddar-chicken-611d22ff1fc432111c386609">www.hellofresh.com</a>: I like this website because each section is in their own block, making the separation clearer. Also, it's helpful to have each ingredients and instruction steps with images for those who are unfamilar. The huge image of the food at the top is a good eye-catcher.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/262309/chinese-braised-pork-belly/">www.allrecipes.com</a>: I like this website mainly for the ability to multiply the serving size for the ingredients, very flexible. Also, the layout is more centered, which is easier to look. The color palatte of white and orange is minimalistic and effective.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/chicken-rice-soup">www.bonappetit.com</a>I like this website since the font is unique and memorizable. It also has the big eye-grabbing image. I also kind of like the ingredients and instructions go side-by-side, which takes more advantage of a desktop screen and makes checking them together easier.</p>

        <h2>Non-recipe websites:</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Live-in-Harmony-with-Others">www.wikihow.com</a>: I like this website for its block based structure and vertically centered layout. Also the bolded font for important points in the instructions helps communication. For longer pages, having a table of contents at the top is beneficial.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">www.duolingo.com</a>: I like this website because it has a nice color palatte and centered layout. Also, the text and imagery switching orders creates a visual flow that's more engaging, although I'm unsure if this would be as effective for a recipe website. It gives white space for elements very generously, making the page clean.</p>
        <p><a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/passwords/recommendations-mchl506a0d14/mac">support.apple.com</a>: I like this website because of Apple's minimalistic design. The use of indentation in its texts are consistent and pleasing to look at. I also like the use of a light break line between sections: it separates the sections without being too obvious.</p>
