        This song is a conversation between Sufjan and his mother, Carrie, while she was dying in the hospital. Each
        stanza alternates between them.

        <p><i>[VERSE]</i></p>
        <p>The evil, it spread like a fever ahead</p>
        <p>It was night when you died, my firefly</p>
        <p>What could I have said to raise you from the dead?</p>
        <p>Oh, could I be the sky on the Fourth of July?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="chorus">
        <p><i>[CHORUS]</i></p>
        <p>"Well, you do enough talk</p>
        <p>My little hawk, why do you cry?</p>
        <p>Tell me, what did you learn from the Tillamook burn?</p>
        <p>Or the Fourth of July?</p>
        <p>We're all gonna die"</p>

    <div class="verse">
        <p><i>[VERSE]</i></p>
        <p>Sitting at the bed with the halo at your head</p>
        <p>Was it all a disguise, like junior high?</p>
        <p>Where everything was fiction, future, and prediction</p>
        <p>Now, where am I? My fading supply</p>
    </div>

    <div class="chorus">
        <p><i>[CHORUS]</i></p>
        <p>"Did you get enough love, my little dove?</p>
        <p>Why do you cry?</p>
        <p>And I'm sorry I left, but it was for the best</p>
        <p>Though it never felt right</p>
        <p>My little Versailles"</p>
    </div>

    <div class="verse">
        <p><i>[VERSE]</i></p>
        <p>The hospital asked, "Should the body be cast?"</p>
        <p>Before I say goodbye, my star in the sky</p>
        <p>Such a funny thought to wrap you up in cloth</p>
        <p>Do you find it all right, my dragonfly?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="chorus">
        <p><i>[CHORUS]</i></p>
        <p>"Shall we look at the moon, my little loon?</p>
        <p>Why do you cry?</p>
        <p>Make the most of your life, while it is rife</p>
        <p>While it is light</p>
        <p>Well, you do enough talk</p>
        <p>My little hawk, why do you cry?</p>
        <p>Tell me, what did you learn from the Tillamook burn?</p>
        <p>Or the Fourth of July?</p>
        <p>We're all gonna die"</p>
